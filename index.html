    <p id="intro" style="margin-top: 150px;">A mobile application, most commonly referred to as an app, is a type of
        application software
        designed to run on a mobile
        device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. Mobile applications frequently serve to provide users with
        similar
        services to those accessed on PCs. Apps are generally small, individual software units with limited function.
        This
        use
        of app software was originally popularized by Apple Inc. and its App Store, which offers thousands of
        applications
        for
        the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

        A mobile application also may be known as an app, web app, online app, iPhone app or smartphone app.</p>

                    source software,
                    designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is
